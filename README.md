# AsyncTaskRetainedFragment
**Description:**
This Android app is a sample project showcasing the use of AsyncTask and a retained fragment to fetch data from a RESTful API and display it in a RecyclerView. The app uses the Retrofit library for network requests and excels at handling configuration changes, such as screen rotation, without losing data or interrupting background tasks.

**Key Features:**

1) Asynchronous Data Fetching: The app demonstrates how to perform asynchronous data fetching from a remote API using Retrofit and AsyncTask, ensuring that the main UI thread remains responsive during network operations.

2) Robust Configuration Change Handling: Leveraging a retained fragment, the app retains its instance across configuration changes like screen rotation. This ensures that ongoing background tasks, such as data fetching, continue seamlessly, preserving the user experience.

3) RecyclerView: The retrieved data is efficiently displayed in a RecyclerView, which efficiently manages the display of a large dataset using a custom adapter.

4) Error Handling: The app includes basic error handling to gracefully deal with network issues or API call failures.

5) Clean Code: The code is thoughtfully organized into separate packages for clarity and follows best practices for Android development. It also includes comments for easy understanding.

6) API Integration: It integrates with the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to fetch a list of sample items (posts).

**Usage:**

This app serves as an educational resource for Android developers who want to learn how to handle asynchronous tasks and configuration changes effectively in Android applications. It demonstrates the importance of retaining fragments to preserve the app's state across configuration changes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this sample app as a reference or starting point for your Android projects. If you find it helpful, consider giving it a star on GitHub and contributing to its improvement.

**Note:** This sample app was created with educational purposes in mind and may not be suitable for production use without further refinement and additional features. It's an excellent starting point for understanding the fundamentals of Android development, especially when it comes to handling background tasks and configuration changes.
